# Battleship
Console version of Battleship game coded in Java. Currently working on the GUI version of it.
Compile all the files and run the Main.java file to start the demo of game.
All of the source code is currently under working atsge as well,
so comment and more efficient methods are subject to changes and updates will be made every time changes is/are done.
I will uplode the source code for GUI version of game as well once it starts talking some shape.
Any changes and recommendations regarding this project will be most welcomed.
Thankyou,
Het Patel
