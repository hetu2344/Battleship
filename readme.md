# Update 1
#### Date: 1 April, 2023
By mistake I uploded the GUI version of `Main.java`, which is currently in progress and does not include the 
main(Strings[] args) class to run the console version of game. So I changed that to correct version of it.
# Update 2

Their way a major error in `fits(int[] co)` method, which check whether the ship can be placed or not at the
given cordinates, in `Game.java` file. I have changes to correct and now their is no error in the code and it is perfectly
fine to run.
